# GeneratePermissions
A framework for managing SQL Server users and roles in source control on a per environment basis.

This is based on the earleir work by Peter Schott. Peter's version was designed only to work with SSDT, but I plan to extend it to work in pure PowerShell, allowing everyone to use it regardless of database tooling.

Peter Schott would also like to attribute Jamie Thompson (https://twitter.com/jamiet) who created the original version for Data Dude, which Peter himself updated for use with Visual Studio Database Projects.
